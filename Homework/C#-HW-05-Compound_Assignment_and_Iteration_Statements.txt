C# Programming Homework Homework 05 Chapter 05, C# Step by Step Readings Read chapter 5 in the C# Step by Step book. 
Discussion Questions Answer the discussion questions in writing. 

1. What is a compound assignment operator? How does it work? 
Syntaxis to perform an arithmetic task in a shorthand manner. 
variable = variable + number is the same as variable += number;

2. List all the compound assignment operators. 
variable *= number;
variable /= number;
variable %= number;
variable += number;
variable -= number;

3. List two ways to increment a numeric variable by 5. List two ways to decrement a numeric variable by 50. 
variable += 5;
variable = variable + 5;

variable -= 50;
variable = variable - 50;

4. How long does a while loop run? 
as long as some condition is true.

5. What is an iteration variable? (Not in book) 
the iteration variable is the variable that is changed each iteration of the loop.

6. What happens if you don’t change the loop variable in the body of the while loop block? 
The while loop will run nonstop

7. How many parts does a for loop statement have? Can you omit any of them? Can you omit all of them? What happens if you omit all of them? 
initialization 
while (Boolean expression) 
{ 
  statement 
  update control variable 
}

8. How do you guarantee that a loop runs at least once?
With a do {} while () loop

 9. What does the break statement do? 
jump out of the body of an iteration statement

10. What does the continue statement do? 
causes the program to perform the next iteration of the loop immediately (after reevaluating the Boolean expression).

11. (Thought question) Can you think of any reason why you would want to have an infinite loop? An “infinite loop” is a loop without an update variable that in effect runs forever. As you will see, these kinds of loops are written intentionally to perform various kinds of tasks.
A security program running in the back, which must intentionally be always active is an example of an infinite loop program.
